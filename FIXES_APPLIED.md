# Timer Fixes Applied

## Issue #1: Text Visibility When Timer Expires
**Problem:** When the timer expired, the "Time Expired - Form Disabled" message had the same color as the background, making it invisible.

**Root Cause:** The CSS for the expired state was missing explicit styling for the message text color.

**Fix Applied:** Added explicit white text color and background styling for the expired message:

```css
.aws-countdown-overlay.aws-countdown-expired .aws-countdown-message {
  color: var(--aws-white) !important;
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) !important;
}
```

**Location:** `aws-countdown-extension/styles.css` (lines 156-159)

## Issue #2: Timer Not Restarting When Navigating to /task/1
**Problem:** When navigating from a non-task page (like /home) to /task/1, the timer was not resetting to 10:00 as expected.

**Root Cause:** The reset logic in `handleCountdownMatch()` only worked if the timer was already initialized (`this.isInitialized` was true). When navigating from a non-task page, the timer might not be initialized yet, so the reset was skipped.

**Fix Applied:** 
1. Modified the reset logic to work regardless of initialization state
2. **Enhanced:** Timer is now cleared immediately when navigating to ANY non-task page
3. This ensures the timer always starts fresh when returning to /task/1

**Locations:** 
- `aws-countdown-extension/content-script.js` (lines 1860-1880) - Reset logic
- `aws-countdown-extension/content-script.js` (lines 1957-1975) - Clear on non-task navigation

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before: Reset only worked if timer was initialized
if (shouldReset && this.isInitialized) {
  this.resetTimer();
  return;
}

// After: Reset works regardless of initialization state
if (shouldReset) {
  console.log('AWS Countdown Timer: Resetting timer - navigated to /task/1 from non-task page');
  // Clear existing timer state first
  this.clearExistingTimerState();
  
  // If already initialized, reset the timer
  if (this.isInitialized) {
    this.resetTimer();
    return;
  }
  // If not initialized, we'll initialize fresh below
}
```

## Testing
Created `test-fixes.html` to verify both fixes:
1. **Text Visibility Test:** Force timer expiration to check message visibility
2. **Timer Reset Test:** Navigate between task and non-task pages to verify reset behavior

## Expected Behavior After Fixes
1. **Expired Timer:** White "Time Expired - Form Disabled" text on red background
2. **Navigation Reset:** Timer resets to 10:00 when going to /task/1 from non-task pages
3. **Cross-Task Persistence:** Timer continues across /task/1, /task/2, /task/3, etc.
4. **Form Disabling:** Form elements are disabled when timer expires on any task page
5. **ðŸ†• Immediate Clear:** Timer is cleared immediately when navigating to any non-task page
##
 Additional Enhancement: Immediate Timer Clear on Non-Task Navigation

**New Behavior:** Timer is now cleared immediately when navigating to any page that is not `/task/*`.

**Implementation:** Modified `handleUrlNoMatch()` method to:
```javascript
handleUrlNoMatch() {
  console.log('AWS Countdown Timer: URL pattern no longer matches - clearing timer state');
  
  // Clear timer state when navigating to non-task pages
  this.clearExistingTimerState();
  
  // Stop and destroy current timer if it exists
  if (this.isInitialized) {
    this.timer.destroy();
    this.display.destroy();
    this.elementDisabler.restoreAllElements();
    this.isInitialized = false;
    this.isAutoActivated = false;
  }
  
  console.log('AWS Countdown Timer: Timer cleared - will reset when returning to /task/1');
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Ensures timer always starts fresh when returning to task pages
- Prevents timer state from persisting across different sections of the application
- Provides cleaner user experience with predictable timer behavior
- Automatically restores any disabled form elements when leaving task pages
